\section{Instruction Sets}

\emph{Arithmetic Operations}: treat operands as numbers; consider signs;
(\eg arithmetic shift = multiplication/division by 2, sign bit preserved).\\
\emph{Logical Operations}: treat operands as bit patterns; discard bits shifted out;
replenish new bits with 0.\\
\emph{Rotate Operations}: put bits shifted out back into the other end of the number;
are logical operations.\\
