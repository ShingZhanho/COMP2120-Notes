# COMP2120 Cheatsheet

This directory contains the files for compiling a two-page A4 cheatsheet for the course
COMP2120. It uses a LaTeX template from
[kenfehling/latex-cheatsheet](https://github.com/kenfehling/latex-cheatsheet).

Currently, there is no plan to provide a compiled PDF on GitHub.
You must download the source code and compile on your own.
