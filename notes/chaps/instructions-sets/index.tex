\subsubsection{Arithmetic \& Logical Instructions}

\textbf{Arithmetic} operations treat operands as numbers and have to consider the sign
of the operands. Arithmetic shifts are equivalent to multiplication (left shift) or
division (right shift) by 2 with remainders shifted out. The new bits are filled with
sign bits on the left, and 0's on the right.

\textbf{Logical} operations treat operands as bit patterns. Logical shifts simply discard
the bits shifted out and replenish the new bits with 0's.

There are also \textbf{rotate} operations, which put the bits shifted out back into the
other end of the number.
